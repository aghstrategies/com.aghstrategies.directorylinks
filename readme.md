When viewing profile listings (profile search results) or a profile view (one profile) this extension makes emails clickable always and phone numbers clickable only when viewing on a phone.

When using a profile:
---------------------
  + If an email or phone field is set as "Public Pages" or "Public Pages and Listing"
  + For all email and phone types (home, primary etc.)
  + On the search listings view and when viewing an individual contact record this extension makes:
    + All Emails clickable to email using ``<a href="mailto:___ ">`` regardless of whether one is using a phone or desktop.
    + If viewing on phone: all phone number types clickable to call using ``<a href="tel:___">``
    + If viewing on a desktop phone numbers appear just as plain text
